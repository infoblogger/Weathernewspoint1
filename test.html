<p style="text-align: justify;">When you meet new people and they share your preferences to discover common ground there are some who are shocked when I explain to them that <strong>I like meteorology</strong> and I own <strong>two weather stations at home</strong> and several thermometers. they may also be surprised to share with you the fact that they have an unimportant weather station or a barometer that was inherited by their grandfather.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, they ask me what is it that you like about meteorology? Why are you interested in knowing the exact time of every minute? It's definitely difficult to explain, but it's like an instinct which makes you aware to the weather and the things it will accomplish. Perhaps it was, and these are my theories, when we lived in caves and had only started to walk on our feet as well as comprehend and interact with our physical world in a distinct way from other animals, every social group of this primitive world was born as an expert in their respective field and a hunter expert who guided the tribe towards catch prey, or shaman who spiritually guided the tribe, a leader, a handyman and why not an expert <strong>meteorologist</strong> who would blend his interest or knowledge with <strong>meteorology</strong>with another profession, possibly in conjunction with a shaman in which many of the duties of a physicist and chemist etc. were combined. In the present, and in all the <strong>of meteorology</strong> was just something magical and inexplicable at the time. All I'm saying is it is true that <strong>that this "meteorologist" instinct</strong> is sometimes inherited as well as developed through certain people and even though we're no meteorologists by any means but we are awestruck by this region and act as a reference to our tiny tribes which surround us.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why should we be paying close attention to the forecast for weather?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For me, these are the most important reasons why you have to follow the forecast for the weather and why you should have a weather station in your home even if it's not the case that you have a passion for science in meteorology:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Plan your activities. Do you plan to do something? Do you know if it's going to rainand at what hour, or if the forecast is cold? Perhaps some knowledge would allow you to optimize your time and activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Choose the right clothes. No one likes being cold. It's a bad way to ruin our day. You could also get wet because we did not take an umbrella to the office in the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Knowledge of our limits. When we keep track of the temperature and the weather We can learn the limits of our thermal capabilities and when we need to wrap up or remove our clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- <strong>Save on cooling and heating.</strong>To many people it may seem absurd however, if you are able how to control and understand the perfect temperature inside as well as the way outside temperatures affect the inside of your house I am confident that you can significantly improve the utilization of energy to control it. If you also have an expectation of a sudden change in the weather, you could take preventive measures and make more efficient use. For instance, if you know in advance that a cold storm is coming, you can profit from the high outside temperature before the cold storm to increase the temperature inside by making use of less energy since it is not so cold. When the cold comes, you've already heated the house. This does not mean that you will save money in the long run, but by implementing tiny optimizations, you could save money over the course of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be careful when talking on the subject of weather. If you know how the meteorology in your locale functions, you'll be able speak to guidelines of how severe the meteorology is acting.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How do you follow the weather forecast and meteorology in a simple way?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of this said, I'd like to recommend to people that they should be more attentive to the weather, and also have some kind of criterion to analyze of the information about weather we receive daily, because often I have read or heard nonsense. In this regard, I suggest a few things to be up-to-date and which cost very little time:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- <strong>You should have an indoor weather station</strong> , with thermometer, hygrometer and barometer, or at least, if it also has an anemometer or an instrument for measuring rain, great. I leave you a link with a few options</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <strong>Why should you have a weather station at home?</strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What gives us the advantage of a weather station located at your home is instant updates with localised information. We are aware of what the weather will be like in our region and the forecast that the station is giving us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <strong>- - Look at the date on several webpages, ordered by in order of importance:</strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Official website that is operated by the State Meteorological Agency. You will find the most precise information about the development of the weather warnings, weather conditions and half-time forecasts. They are the most trustworthy, reliable and precise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also look up and compare the weather on these other pages , which can offer forecasts of longer-term weather however, these forecasts are a bit difficult to be accurate and frequently change.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">How do you forecast possible short-term precipitation?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather, including snowfalls, storms and rain are among the events which we most worry about when we plan our activities. In Spain in order to know if it is going to rain in the near term , or if a storm with rain is moving towards our area, and how intense it is, I suggest to look up the AEMET radars. You will be able see in detail the pattern of precipitation over the area you live in.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">It is best to go to the weather forecast?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no specific time that is the most accurate since the weather and forecast is constantly changing and if I am not mistaking, updates of the weather forecast are made every 6 hours. I usually check it before I wake up or leave my home in the morning, after I have left work, and at night to see the day's forecast.</p>
